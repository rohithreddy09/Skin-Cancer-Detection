# Skin-Cancer-Detection
This project leverages machine learning to detect skin cancer from images. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN), the system classifies skin lesions as benign or malignant with high accuracy. The model is trained on a large dataset of labeled images, providing a valuable tool for early cancer diagnosis.

Download the dataset from the above link and unzip that and upload into jupiter notebook and then you can follow the code which is uploaded as TensorFlowProject.ipynb file formate. Then you will get the resultes.


About the dataset.

A training set for academic machine learning can be created using the dataset, which comprises of 10015 dermatoscopic images. All significant diagnostic categories for pigmented lesions are represented in the cases in a representative manner:

Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinoma / Bowen's disease (akiec),
basal cell carcinoma (bcc),
benign keratosis-like lesions (solar lentigines / seborrheic keratoses and lichen-planus like keratoses, bkl),
dermatofibroma (df),
melanoma (mel),
melanocytic nevi (nv) and
vascular lesions (angiomas, angiokeratomas, pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage, vasc).
Histopathology (histo) is used to confirm more than 50% of lesions; in the remaining cases, follow-up exams, expert consensus, or in-vivo confocal microscopy confirmation are used as the gold standard (confocal).
