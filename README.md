# Skin-Cancer-Detection
This project leverages machine learning to detect skin cancer from images. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN), the system classifies skin lesions as benign or malignant with high accuracy. The model is trained on a large dataset of labeled images, providing a valuable tool for early cancer diagnosis.
